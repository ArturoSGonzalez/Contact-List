# Contact-List
This is a simple address book. 
The basic functions of the app are to add a contact,remove a contact, view the list of contacts, 
search a specific contact by full name and removing a contact.
I only have one class in this project that displays the information for the contact the user enters.
The 5 methods i have correspond to the four prompts in the master loop, AddPerson(),Remove(),
Announce(),PrintPerson() and Search().
Of the features list i was able to include a master loop for the user to choose from prompting.
I created a List to store the user input contact and can be retrieved. 
The List stores to my second feature a Csv file. It is able to read and write,
the only thing i was not able to accomplish was the ability to remove from the file.
1 Master Loop
2 List
3 Csv file

The ones that got away-
Ability to remove data from csv file
adding regex to verify email or phone number
search options other than full name (email or phone number)


Thanks :)
